## Coffee House

Coffee House is a well-known multinational chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves, with its headquarters in Seattle, Washington. It was founded in 1971 and has since become the world's largest coffeehouse chain.

Coffee House is known for its high-quality coffee and espresso drinks, as well as a wide selection of tea, pastries, sandwiches, and other food items. The company prides itself on using only the finest coffee beans from around the world, and its expert baristas are trained to create the perfect cup of coffee every time.

In addition to its coffeehouses, Coffee House also operates roastery reserves, which are large-scale production facilities where the company roasts and packages its coffee beans for distribution to its coffeehouses and retail partners around the world. The company is committed to sustainable sourcing practices and works closely with farmers and suppliers to ensure that its coffee beans are ethically sourced and of the highest quality.

Coffee House has a large customer base and has consistently experienced high retention rates in the past, which is a testament to the quality of its products and the level of customer service it provides. The company is committed to providing a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere for its customers, with many of its coffeehouses featuring comfortable seating areas, free Wi-Fi, and other amenities.

In recent years, Coffee House has faced increased competition from other coffee retailers, as well as a decline in repeat customers and revenue. To address these challenges, the company has embarked on a data analysis project to better understand the factors contributing to the decline in retention rates and identify potential solutions to improve retention and increase revenue.

Overall, Coffee House is a leader in the coffee industry, known for its high-quality products, commitment to sustainability, and dedication to providing a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere for its customers. The company's roastery reserves and coffeehouses are just a few of the many ways in which it delivers on its promise to provide customers with the best possible coffee experience.

# <h2 id="link2">Project Background</h2>

Coffee House, the world's largest coffeehouse chain, noticed a decline in the number of repeat customers and a corresponding decline in revenue over the past year. After conducting customer feedback surveys, they identified a few factors that could be contributing to the decline in retention rates. These factors include a lack of variety in product offerings, poor customer service, and increased competition from other retailers.

To better understand the factors contributing to the decline in retention rates and identify potential solutions to improve retention and increase revenue, Coffee House has decided to conduct a data analysis project.

# <h2 id="link3">Project Objectives</h2>  

The objective of this data analysis project is to understand the factors contributing to the decline in retention rates and identify potential solutions to improve retention. To achieve this objective, the following steps will be undertaken:

Cleaning and preparing the given dataset for analysis: The first step in any data analysis project is to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. This involves identifying missing data, removing duplicates, and ensuring that the data is in the right format for analysis.

Exploring data to identify trends and patterns: Once the dataset is cleaned and prepared, the next step is to explore the data to identify trends and patterns. This involves conducting descriptive analysis, identifying correlations between variables, and visualizing the data using charts and graphs.

Modeling data using statistics to identify factors contributing to retention rates: After exploring the data, the next step is to model the data using statistics to identify the factors contributing to retention rates. This involves applying statistical techniques such as regression analysis and machine learning algorithms to the dataset.

Developing solutions to the given problem statement in the light of your data insights using visualizations: Based on the data insights and analysis, the final step is to develop solutions to the given problem statement. This involves developing actionable insights and recommendations that can help Coffee House improve retention rates and increase revenue. The solutions will be presented using visualizations such as charts, graphs, and tables.

# <h2 id="link4">Detailed EDA Analysis for Customer Retention</h2>  

To gain a deeper understanding of the EDA analysis performed, it is recommended to visit the __Customer_Retention_EDA.ipynb file__. In this file, you can explore the detailed data column descriptions, data preprocessing techniques, such as removing outliers and handling errors in data formats.

Additionally, the EDA analysis includes feature encoding and feature scaling techniques. Feature encoding is used to convert categorical features into numerical representations that can be used in statistical models. Feature scaling techniques are used to scale numerical features to ensure that they are on a similar scale and have equal weight in statistical models.

Overall, the detailed EDA analysis provides insights into the factors that are contributing to the decline in customer retention rates and provides potential solutions to improve retention.
